A stellar-like 3D Graph for Obsidian. Bring your notes to life with an interactive, immersive 3D graph view! This plugin transforms your Obsidian vault into a dynamic universe, where each note becomes a star and links form the constellations connecting your knowledge.

Whether you're a visual thinker, a graph enthusiast, or just want a fresh way to explore your vault, this plugin lets you zoom, rotate, and dive through your notes in a FPV fashion.

## âœ¨ Features 3D graph view powered by WebGL and Three.js

Dynamic positioning and linking based on your note structure.
Responsive layout that scales with your vault

## ðŸ’» Performance Note

Physics simulation requires to do a reasonable amount of calculations, so expect some CPU and RAM usage.
Feel free to report in issues your specs, the vault dimension and the load on your hardware.

Load on my mahcine with a 500 files test vault:
- RAM: DDR4 / ~30MB
- CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 1600 / ~0.2%
